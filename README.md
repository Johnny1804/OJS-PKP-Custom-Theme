# OJS-PKP-Custom-Theme
Created a custom theme for the OJS Platform

Starting with the default theme. I tried to bring something now but also old. 
Being inspired by an older version of the OJS platform, on the left I tried to add a new sidebar that would be parallel to the rest of the existing elements.

Moreover, some changes have been made to the header so that the logo can be displayed together with the title at the same time.

Through these changes, changes were made regarding the appearance of the diary for both the desktop and the phone version.
